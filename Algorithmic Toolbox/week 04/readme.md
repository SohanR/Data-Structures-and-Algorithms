## Week 4

# Divide-and-Conquer

In this module you will learn about a powerful algorithmic technique called Divide and Conquer. Based on this technique, you will see how to search huge databases millions of times faster than using na√Øve linear search. You will even learn that the standard way to multiply numbers (that you learned in the grade school) is far from the being the fastest! We will then apply the divide-and-conquer technique to design two efficient algorithms (merge sort and quick sort) for sorting huge lists, a problem that finds many applications in practice. Finally, we will show that these two algorithms are optimal, that is, no algorithm can sort faster!

### Key Concepts

- Express the recurrence relation on the running time of an algorithm
- Create a program for searching huge lists
- Create a program for finding a majority element
- Create a program for organizing a lottery
